    <p class="moji">This website and pieces of paper represent a story of what the earth would be like due to climate change. This project consists of two components; physical, and digital. The era in which this story takes place is 2065, and the reader as a researcher exposes the past which was left blank by climate change. First, the reader finds an old dusty diary which has some wholes and four pictures. QR codes are hidden in the four pieces and each of them is connected to a web page. The web page describes what happened in the past due to environmental pollution.</p>
    <p class="moji">I choose these pieces as one of my artifacts because this is my first group project in my university life. In comparison to my college, there were few international students at the University, and I was worried to communicate with people who speak English very comfortably.  Meanwhile, this project helped me as being an icebreaker. These pieces of art also show how much effort we put into ideas. Thus, this project to me means a new journey; new discovery to meet people and specific knowledge and skill. I learned the importance of team work through the project. </p>

    <p class="moji">This cardboard presentation is about a Japanese telecom company, SoftBank group. Nishibori divides the company's development into three eras; Selling electronic era, carrier investing era, and investing era. This changing era shows Softbank's development from a small company to one of the biggest companies.  
        <p class="moji">I choose this artifact because it shows I can visually represent a subject that can also be easily understood to any reader. I made a timeline to show the changes in the company so that the reader can see that has happened in the order they occurred, and be fully informed. This artifact also shows the time I invest into a specific idea and energy I can put into a project. For example, I drew myself into the art. Through the project, I leaned it is important to visually represent what I leaned and ideas.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1> 
			<p>
			Nothing. <br>This is what I felt before I came to the U.S. While I was staying at home all the time. I dropped out of high school when I was 15; I was a freshman in high school in Japan. Even though I felt sorry for my mother who paid a ridiculous amount of money for school, I did not enjoy spending time at school. I felt teachers were just reading whatever the textbook said. At that time, I had been experiencing being an adolescent. I was not sure what I was doing. Since my mother paid so much money to my public high school, I was questioning what I was actually learning. Was it worth it? At the same time, I was questioning my sexuality. In my culture, if it is different from others, you would be judged or criticized. I was pretending to be “normal.” I was dating a classmate just like my friends were doing while at the same time noticing I did not feel like my true self. However, spending time in the U.S for four years, exposed to the culture, and meeting many awesome people , helped me grow as a person. In addition to this, I gained skills and knowledge on IAS at the University of Washington Bothell as MCS and SEB major.

				My journey had already started when I lost my goal in my life. I recalled an old memory from when I went to New Zealand. My school offered the opportunity to ten students every year. People who were accepted got to study abroad for two weeks during our summer break. I was chosen as a participant when I was fourteen. When I was in New Zealand, every single second was full of surprise. The geography, food, humanity, and everything was different from what I thought was normal; I learned that I lived in such a small world. It was enough for me to want to travel around the world. I was seventeen when I came to Seattle. The color of people’s skin, what people ate, and how people reacted to each other, was different. This forced me to remember that I used to live in such a small country.
				As of now, I have lived in the U.S. for four years. I learned a lot in these four years, not only about education but also as a human. For the first two years, I went to Seattle Central College. Because I did not graduate high school, and I did not have any interest in specific subjects, my goal at that time was just graduating from a community college so that I could finally show that I graduated college. <br>
				I was going to just take classes that I had to complete my requirement to graduate. However, I found the joy of studying with my peers and teachers during my first quarter. I enjoyed the cooperative learning style with students who had different backgrounds from me. This enhanced my identity and I was able to see how diverse this world is.
				I believed that interests, concerns, and cooperation are key elements and they became my motivation and passions. At that time, I wanted to study more and learn how to make a change to society that being different was considered to be weird.
